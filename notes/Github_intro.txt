1)
in raltime, coding in diff places and pushing into a cloud space like github,

examples for cloud spaces : github, bitbucket, gitlab, AWS, azure/ other custom cloud places.
calling as "source management tools".
to push and pull between local and  cloud places a technology is using , i.e., version control system.
in old days "SVN" version control system used, compare with "SVN", "Git" is fast and convienent.
so, now days "Git" is using.

Git and Github both are diff.

Git      -  version control system (link b/w local machine and cloud storage)
Github   -  cloud space / storage
push     -  transfer data from local machine to cloud space (means, local to cloud)
pull     -  transfer data from cloud space to local machine (means, cloud to local)

=================================================================================================

2) if ".gitignore" not working, run below 3 commands :


warning :  backup project before run first command, just in case.
don't change anything in local machine upto run 2nd command.

to delete everyting from github
command 1 :    git rm -r --cached .

to add all files to github
command 2 :    git add .  (must mention with space after add, i.e., "  .") 

to commit with message
