1)
in raltime, coding in diff places and pushing into a cloud space like github,

examples for cloud spaces : github, bitbucket, gitlab, AWS, azure/ other custom cloud places.
these are calling as "source management tools".
to push and pull between local and  cloud places a technology is using , i.e., version control system.
in old days "SVN" used, compare with "SVN", "Git" is fast and convienent.
so, now days "Git" is using.

Git and Github both are diff.

Git      -  version control system (link b/w local machine and cloud storage)
Github   -  cloud space / storage
push     -  transfer data from local machine to cloud space (means, local to cloud)
pull     -  transfer data from cloud space to local machine (means, cloud to local)
