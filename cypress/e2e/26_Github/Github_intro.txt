1)
in raltime, coding in diff places and pushing into a cloud space like github,

examples for cloud spaces : github, bitbucket, gitlab, AWS, azure/ other custom cloud places.
these are calling as "source management tools".
to push and pull between local and  cloud places a technology is using , i.e., version control system.
in old days "SVN" used, compare with "SVN", "Git" is fast and convienent.
so, now days "Git" is using.

Git and Github both are diff.

Git      -  version control system (link b/w local machine and cloud storage)
Github   -  cloud space / storage
push     -  transfer data from local machine to cloud space (means, local to cloud)
pull     -  transfer data from cloud space to local machine (means, cloud to local)

=================================================================================================

2) 
if ".gitignore" not working follow below 3 commands :

// to stop track all  files
command 1 :    git rm -r --cached .

// to add all files to github
command 2 :    git add .

just commit command with message
command 3 :     git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"
==========================================================================

3)  to pull and push single file and ignore remaining in a folder  :


can't "push and pull"  means "ignore"

// can't "push and pull" all sub files and folders of "testData" folder,
// but can "push and pull",  "testData" folder name
command 1 : cypress/fixtures/testData/*

// can "push and pull",  "login.json" file,
remaining all sub files and folders will not "push and pull", inside "testData" folder.
!cypress/fixtures/testData/login.json
