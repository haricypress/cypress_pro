1) importing test data : 
use "import" statement, if test data want use in entire script file (with or without multiple test-suites).
example : fixtures_01.cy

2) cloading test data with cy.fixture() :
use "cy.fixture()"  within test-case, if test data want use within single test-case only.
example : fixtures_02.cy

use "cy.fixture()"  within "beforeEach()" under test-suite, if test data want use in multiple test-cases. 
example : fixtures_03.cy

3) cy.fixture() using with "var" type variable :
pass data from "cy.fixture()" to "var" type variable , if changable data want use in multiple test-cases.
but data changing in "var" variable, not in "cy.fixture()".

declare "var" variable at starting of script file, if changable data want use in multiple test-suites.
declare "var" variable under test-suite, if changable data want use in single test-suite only.

4) in javascript,"this" keyword has block scope, but if not declared, it uses parent's data.
example : fixtures_05.cy

5) "puase()" used to debug within test-case,
click on resume button or press "c" keyword in "test runner" to resume.
